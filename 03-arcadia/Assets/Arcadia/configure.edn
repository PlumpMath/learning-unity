;; This file constitutes hard-coded defaults for Arcadia options. To
;; override this file, place an edn file containing a map literal at
;; Assets/AracadiaConfig/configure.edn. That file will be merged into
;; this one, with submaps merged recursively. Some standard options are given in comments below.

{:compiler {:warn-on-reflection true, :unchecked-math false, :enabled true, :debug true},
 :verbose true

 ;; :injections are forms that are evaluated before the Arcadia REPL
 ;; evaluates each input form. They are useful for requiring or using
 ;; common namespaces.
 ;; example:
 ;;  :injections (do (use 'arcadia.core) (use 'clojure.repl))
